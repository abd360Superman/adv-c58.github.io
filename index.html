            <p>Hi I am Darsh, and I love exploring technology. In my free-time, I like to do anything Technology related like making movies, doing programming and exploring apps and websites. I explore about everything and then try to learn it. I like to explore things which will be useful for me in the future and learn tricks from which I can help others. I explore about technology because I am curious how it works. Anyone can have the same hobby if they are curious and have the guts to explore the dangerous internet. </p>
